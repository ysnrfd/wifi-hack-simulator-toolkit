## üåü Introduction
The Wi-Fi Security Simulator is an interactive educational package that:
- Demonstrates common Wi-Fi attack mechanisms **in simulated environments**
- Teaches security vulnerabilities in WEP/WPA/WPA2 protocols
- Designed for cybersecurity students, beginner pentesters, and enthusiasts
- **Makes NO actual connections to real networks**

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features
- üé≠ Common attack simulations:
  - `Deauth Attack` (Service disruption)
  - `Evil Twin` (Rogue access point)
  - `WEP/WPA2 Cracking` (Simulated environment)
- üìä Interactive reporting system
- üì∂ Wi-Fi network simulator with various security profiles
- üß™ Isolated lab environment with zero real-world impact
- üñ•Ô∏è CLI interface with step-by-step guidance

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ysnrfd/wifi-hack-simulator-toolkit.git
cd wifi-hack-simulator-toolkit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running Simulations
```
bash
# View help menu
python simulator.py --help

# Run deauthentication attack simulation
python simulator.py --attack deauth --target TEST_NETWORK

# Simulate Evil Twin attack
python simulator.py --attack evil_twin --ssid "Free_WiFi"
üìö Simulation Environment
The tool automatically creates a sandboxed environment with:

text
üì∂ Simulated Networks:
- HOME_WIFI (WPA2)
- CAFE_NET (Open)
- OFFICE_SECURE (WPA3)

üîí Test Credentials (Simulation Only):
SSID: HOME_WIFI  Password: "SimulatedPass123!"
ÔøΩ Educational Framework
This simulator teaches core security concepts:

WEP Protocol Weaknesses

IV (Initialization Vector) vulnerabilities

Key recovery attacks

WPA/WPA2 Vulnerabilities

Dictionary attacks

Brute-force techniques

Protection Mechanisms

WPA3 advantages

PMF (Protected Management Frames)

Enterprise authentication principles

üìñ Operational Guide
Creating Attack Scenarios
python
from simulator import AttackScenario

# Configure attack scenario
scenario = AttackScenario(
    ssid="Corporate_Network",
    encryption="WPA2",
    password="WeakPass123"
)

# Execute simulation
scenario.run_simulation(attack_type="deauth")
Sample Output
text
[+] Starting Deauth Attack Simulation...

[+] Sending deauth packets to: Client-1 (00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E)
[‚úî] Simulation completed in 12.8s
[!] 98% of clients disconnected in simulation
‚ùì FAQ
‚ùì Does this tool work on real networks?
No. All operations occur in an isolated simulation environment.

‚ùì What technical knowledge is required?
Basic command-line familiarity and networking concepts are sufficient.

‚ùì Will antivirus flag this tool?
Some antivirus may alert due to attack simulations - this is normal and expected.

‚ùì Can I contribute new attack simulations?
Yes! See our contribution guidelines below.
